It's structured to outline various user journeys, guiding users to specific documents through organized links, often presented in a tree view or a similar hierarchical structure.

1. Central Starting Point: Serves as the main entry point for users exploring the documentation.
2. User Journey Orientations: Lays out different paths users can take, depending on their goals or interests.
3. Hierarchical Navigation: Presents a tree-view or a similar structure to show the relationship between different documents.
4. Linking to Child Documents: Includes links to more specific, detailed documents (child docs) under each section of the user journey.
5. Overview and Context: Provides a brief overview of each section or user journey, giving context before users dive into detailed documents.
6. Flexibility for Exploration: Allows users to easily navigate between different parts of the documentation without losing their way.
