1. Run a sign-in sample app
2. Integrate a sign-in with a quickstart
3. Integrate a sign-in redirect (simplest)
4. Integrate a sign-in embedded widget 
5. Integrate a sign-in with embedded SDK
6. Integrate a sign-in with Direct Auth

",,"Why build?

- The dev docs IA is focus on Action and Task oriented words.
- Most or all developers are building (or will in the future)  a solution with Okta

Why the type of docs:
- Respondents are looking for:
    - more use cases
    - simplify the content
    - best practices (OIN)

Why the topics chosen:
- User research indicates the top solutions customers are building are:
    - Authentication
    - LCM

PUSH TO PHASE 2 PROPOSAL
I'm proposing to push the ""Quickstarts"" into Phase 2. My reasoning is for the following reasons:

- Quickstarts were heavily discussed when Okta was moving to CIC. But now that we are in WIC, I don't think they make as much sense, considering the workforce focus. We can confirm this at Oktane, however.
- We don't have the resources to create and maintain a set of quick-start guides and full integration guides that describe integrating redirect, embedded, etc.
- A lot of the content in the ""DevDocs Quickstart Report"" guide would fit better in other places in the IA, including IAM fundamentals, WIC vs CIS vs CIC, etc"" 
- I'm questioning how ""quick"" can we a quickstart guide. The current ""quickstart"" guides we currently have on the site, are by no means ""quick"" relative to Auth0's quick start guides.  We don't currently have the infrastructure in place to develop a quickstart like Auth0's with the interface directly in the browser.

After we publish phase 1 and the new IA is in place we can better gauge whether quickstart's make sense.

- Doing a youtube about potential use cases. They have identified 525 custs using unofficial powershell cli. They are the target market. 
- Target them in pendo in admin console - target them and notify them, Tell them Okta as a new powershell cli, Link to youtube podcast.  That is the plan. 
- Along with the youtube podcast, we can guide them to docs, if there are no docs, we might need to include github repo link. Ideally, we have docs.
- Most of the readmes are not that good. You won't be any worse off if using readmes.
